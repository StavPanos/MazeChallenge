     * <p>Similar to <i>Tr√©maux's algorithm</i>. Is an efficient algorithm to find the way out of a maze by marking all the previous positions.
     * The actor follows the same way until a junction is reached. On his way "he marks each block passed" (store the count of visits per block in visitsPerBlock field).
     * Every time a block is passed, actor "marks it" (increase the number of visits for this block by one).</p>
     *
     * <p>Whenever there is more than one possible directions (junction) the actor selects the least visited block for the next move.
     * In case there is more than one possible moves with minimum number of visits the Actor chooses his way
     * either randomly or deterministically (based on the enum Directions ordering). The deterministic version of the algorithm always outputs the same path.
     * The random version of the algorithm may output different paths</p>
     *
     * <p>Ambiguous next moves are solved randomly in case parameter {@code withRandomness == true}
     * or deterministically in case parameter {@code withRandomness == false}</p>
